# Overall design
Current goal: Produce a single stage + bossfight script in a custom engine based on Common
Lisp and Raylib.

Stage is to be themed roughly around music. BGM will be Ojamajo Carnival.

Midbosses: 1-3 of the Ojamajo Doremi girls, haven't decided yet.

Boss: Not sure yet.

## Immediate TODOs
* (willie) implement directional character movement sprites
* (willie) change 0,0 to be in the center like official Touhou games
* fix bottomdragging
* implement player shots and killing enemies
* (willie) investigate if we want to adopt a system similar to the official Touhou games'
  "two-level" position and velocity system
* a simple stage background (e.g. black with scrolling stars or hearts or something, similar to the pc98 backgrounds)
* boss tracking and support
  * spell tracking and hud
* stage pattern design
* boss pattern design
* dialogue system
* player and boss portraits
