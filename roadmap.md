# Overall design
Current goal: Produce a single stage + bossfight script in a custom engine based on Chez
Scheme and Raylib.

Stage is to be themed roughly around music. BGM will be Ojamajo Carnival.

Midbosses: 1-3 of the Ojamajo Doremi girls, haven't decided yet.

Boss: Not sure yet.

## Immediate TODOs
* implement spawn delay and blurred pre-spawn rendering
* implementing directional moving sprites for the player
* implement background speed changes
* implement first chapter of stage to flesh out API's needed
* boss aura
* boss spell circle
* spell tracking and hud
* boss position marker
* dialogue system
* player and boss portraits
* investigate if we want to adopt a system similar to the official Touhou games'
  "two-level" position and velocity system
