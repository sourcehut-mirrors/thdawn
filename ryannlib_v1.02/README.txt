ryannlib v1.02 for LuaSTG-x beta

See data_assets/ryannlibcredits.txt for the credits and terms of use of this assets replacement 
library. Ryann is the one who has made and collected assets for this library.

Some sound files of the original replacement library are altered because of an unsolved bug in 
loading the original sound files. Sakuya player is removed from the library since she uses the 
the SuperPause feature of ex+.

This replacement method has been tested on LuaSTG-x version TP v8.1, on Windows platform.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install ryannlib on LuaSTG-x:
1. Get a copy of LuaSTG-x directory. If you are using your own LuaSTG-x copy, it is recommended to 
create a backup before installing ryannlib because a bug may happen. This copy needs to have data, 
data_assets and background installed (1).

2. extract data.zip and background.zip to their own folders and remove them if they are present in 
LuaSTG-x root directory.

3. Paste folders "data", "background", "data_assets" and "res" into LuaSTG-x root directory. 
Replace all files that have the same names. If you have downloaded other assets in x, they may 
remain where they are after the replacement, so you would have to delete all the contents of 
data_assets folder before this step, except data_assets\THlib\UI\font, which does not have a 
replacement in ryannlib yet.

(1): downloading data.zip, data_assets.zip and background.zip from LuaSTG-x download link and put 
them into LuaSTG-x root directory.

and the replacement should be completed by the end of step 3.
