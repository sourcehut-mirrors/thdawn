+-----------------+
| 2. Installation |
+-----------------+

Extract this ZIP archive to any place of your choosing.

Starting the game depends on your platform:

- On Linux, double-click start.sh.
- On macOS, double-click start.sh. You will likely need to bypass Gatekeeper.
- On Windows, double-click start.bat. Note that on ARM systems, this will run via x86_64
  emulation.

For other platforms, the game may still build and run if Chez Scheme and Raylib are ported
to your platform. Refer to the README.md in the source code distribution to compile the
game for your platform. Reports of success are welcome!

+-----------------+
| 3. Removal      |
+-----------------+

The game is completely self-contained. To uninstall, simply delete the game folder.

If you wish to keep your replays, back up the "replays" folder.

If you wish to keep your play data (spell histories, high scores, etc.), back up the
"playdata.dat" file.

| 4. Questions    |
+-----------------+

Questions and constructive feedback are always welcome.

You can see and reply to messages others have sent here:

You can contribute to the discussion by emailing the public mailing list at
"~williewillus/games-discuss@lists.sr.ht", no quotes. Make sure the tilde at the front is
there. Alternatively, simply click the "New Post" button on the webpage above to pop open
your email client with the address pre-filled.

Why email? Because Discord and other corporate, social media platforms have proven to not
care for their users. This email list is hosted by an organization I trust, and even if
they were to lose that trust, I can easily download the email archive and reupload it
somewhere else.

Please don't be shy; I'd love to hear from you!
